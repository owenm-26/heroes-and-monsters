MONSTERS AND HEROES – GAME RULES

GOAL OF THE GAME

Explore the world, fight monsters, earn gold, gain experience, and level up your heroes.
If all heroes faint, the game ends.

WORLD LAYOUT

The world is a grid made of three types of tiles:

• Common tiles – normal areas where battles may occur
• Market tiles – shops where heroes can buy and sell items
• Inaccessible tiles – cannot be entered

The party can move up, down, left, or right.

HEROES

You start by choosing 1 to 3 heroes.

Each hero has:
• Name
• Level
• Experience
• HP (health)
• MP (mana)
• Strength
• Dexterity
• Agility
• Gold
• Inventory

Hero classes:
• Warriors – focus on strength and agility
• Sorcerers – focus on dexterity and agility
• Paladins – focus on strength and dexterity

MONSTERS

Monsters appear during battles and match the level of your strongest hero.

Each monster has:
• Name
• Level
• HP
• Damage
• Defense
• Dodge chance

Monster types:
• Dragons – higher damage
• Exoskeletons – higher defense
• Spirits – higher dodge chance

MARKETS

Heroes can enter a market when standing on a market tile.

• Heroes shop individually; gold is not shared
• Items include weapons, armor, potions, and spells
• Heroes may only buy items they can afford and that are not above their level
• Items sell for half their original price

BATTLES

Battles occur randomly on common tiles.

• Each battle has the same number of monsters as heroes
• Heroes act first

Each hero may choose ONE action per turn:
• Attack with a weapon
• Cast a spell
• Use a potion
• Equip a weapon or armor
• View stats (does not consume a turn)

Monsters then attack the heroes.

• Heroes and monsters may dodge attacks
• A hero at 0 HP faints and cannot act until the battle ends
• If all heroes faint, the game is over
• If all monsters are defeated, heroes win the battle

AFTER EACH ROUND

Heroes who are still standing regain:
• 10% HP
• 10% MP

REWARDS

If heroes win a battle:
• Heroes who did not faint gain gold and experience
• Fainted heroes revive after the battle with half HP and half MP
• Fainted heroes do NOT receive rewards

LEVELING UP

When a hero gains enough experience, they level up.
